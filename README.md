# Face Generation
This is one of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program projects.  

In this project, we'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Our goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, we'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

## How to Run
There is a notebook called `dlnd_face_generation`. You can run `jupyter notebook` command and open this notebook within the browser to work on it.
